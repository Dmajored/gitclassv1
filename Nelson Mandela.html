        <h3>Notable events in Nelson Mandela's life</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Birth Day:</strong> July 18, 1918
            </li>
            <li> Enrolled at the University of Fort Hare in 1939 </li>
            <li>Mandela joined the anti-apartheid movement, joining the African National Congress in 1942</li>
            <li>
                Mandela directed peaceful, nonviolent acts of defiance against the South African government and its
                racist policies, including the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People
            </li>
            <li>Mandela with fellow ANC leader Oliver Tambo,established South Africa's first Black law practice in 1952,
                specializing in cases resulting from the post-1948 apartheid legislation</li>

            <li> He was intermittently banned (severely restricted in travel, association, and speech) in 1952.</li>

            <li> In December 1956 he was arrested with more than 100 other people on charges of treason that were
                designed to harass antiapartheid activists. Mandela went on trial that same year and eventually was
                acquitted in 1961.</li>
            <li>After the massacre of unarmed Black South Africans by police forces at Sharpeville in 1960 and the
                subsequent banning of the ANC, Mandela abandoned his nonviolent stance and began advocating acts of
                sabotage against the South African regime. He went underground (during which time he became known as the
                Black Pimpernel for his ability to evade capture) and was one of the founders of Umkhonto we Sizwe
                (“Spear of the Nation”), the military wing of the ANC.</li>
            <li>
                In 1962 he went to Algeria for training in guerrilla warfare and sabotage, returning to South Africa
                later that year. On August 5, shortly after his return, Mandela was arrested at a road block in Natal;
                he was subsequently sentenced to five years in prison.
            </li>
            <li>From 1964 to 1982 Mandela was incarcerated at Robben Island Prison, off Cape Town. He was subsequently
                kept at the maximum-security Pollsmoor Prison until 1988,</li>
                <li>
                    On February 11, 1990, the South African government under President de Klerk released Mandela from prison. Shortly after his release, Mandela was chosen deputy president of the ANC; he became president of the party in July 1991. Mandela led the ANC in negotiations with de Klerk to end apartheid and bring about a peaceful transition to nonracial democracy in South Africa.
                </li>

                <li>In April 1994 the Mandela-led ANC won South Africa's first elections by universal suffrage, and on May 10 Mandela was sworn in as president of the countr's first multiethnic government.</li>
